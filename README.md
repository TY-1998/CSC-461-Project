Problem definition: Different application usage of multimedia system
Different applications have different ways to fulfill their functionality from transferring files, entertainment or to helping us in everyday life. Some use similar methods for similar purposes but others have their own ways of fulfilling their functionality. This can be seen in how the application does compression and transmission of data and the reason behind each one. At the current point there is no good source to refer to when trying to find why a certain application may use one method or what method they are using or what kind of method they are using. Without this information, there is no way to learn which method is fitting for the application. Both for the existing app and if you are trying to create a new app.

What has been done:
There is a lot of information on different ways of compression and transmission but there isnâ€™t much information on which application is using what method. Most of them either report on 1 specific application or what their method is used for. For example, Zoom uses H.264 SVC in their compression[1], but there is only one website that gives you this information.

Our approach:
 We plan to gather as much information as we can from the internet, research paper, and our own experience on each of the applications. This is so we can organize and compare all the data to summarize in detail each major application strength and weakness in their chosen method of compression and transmission.

Deliverables:
Search and sort different source                                                                 Oct 09 - Oct 23 \
Research and gather information                                                                  Oct 23 - Nov 06 \
Written out the information found into the paper		                                             Nov 06 - Nov 20 \
Summarise and formatted the information       		                                               Nov 20 - Dec 04 \
Report finding                                                                                   Dec 04 - Dec 11

# Project Update

feedback link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cacx80U5rywkVQxBNp5fu4hDs5rDO-0CZldtjfIxDgc/edit \
final report: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JDQXjg-dYb9dSWTL-CFeIglvWjJCT0yIcN8EewvSPnQ/edit

19/10/23 sorting info based on 3 main type and add more application. \
30/10/23 Problem while research: As expected there isn't much infomation about compression and transmission. Most of the information are from a blog and not the official website. Any information for transmission is even harder to find than compression, if there is any on the internet at all. \
20/11/23 third update, create a final report doc, finish the introduction part, and create a table.
